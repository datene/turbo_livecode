- You will get an URL
- Go to the URL, and go into the menu : Collaborate -> Workspace Permissions -> Check "Edit" and save

## Process

### Before starting
- Create teams
- Define steps (pseudo-code steps, same for all teams)

### Let the competition begin

- For each step
  - Give a time constraint to the teams, and enter that into the wonderful interface
  - When the time runs out review the code of each team and apply the grading system

### Suggested grading system:

+2 points if the code runs
-2 points if the code doesn't run

+1 point for the team that finishes first before the time runs up
+1 point for good style/coherent naming or clever solution (is rubocop happy ?)
-1 point if one team finds a mistake/error in the other team's code (is rubocop unhappy ?)
-1 point if you copy/paste the code from the day's exercices
